Secure Digital Gift Cards on Bitcoin

Giftblock is a protocol for gift card and stored value card on the Bitcoin block chain. It is built as a set of extensions on top of the [Open Assets Protocol](https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol):
* [Store Card Asset Definition File Extensions](store-card-asset-definition-file-extensions.mediawiki)
* Payment Requests specification: extensions to BIP-70 and BIP-21 describing payments in terms of assets instead of (or together with) regular bitcoins. See [Open Assets Protocol](https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol)
* Payment Methods specification: A protocol for negotiating the assets to be included in an Open Assets Payment Request. See [Open Assets Protocol](https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol)
